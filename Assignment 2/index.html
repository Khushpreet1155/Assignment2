                <p class="lyrics"> I never thought that it'd be easy<br>
                    'Cause we both so distant now<br>
                    And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how<br>
                    No one has a solid answer<br>
                    But just walking in the dark<br>
                    And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart<br><br>
                    
                    So we fight through the hurt<br>
                    And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry<br>
                    Then we live and we learn<br>
                    And we try, and try, and try, and try<br><br>

                    So it's up to you and it's up to me<br>
                    That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth<br>
                    Down to earth, down to earth<br>
                    On our way back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br><br>

                    And mommy, you were always somewhere<br>
                    And daddy, I live out of town<br>
                    So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?<br>
                    You tell me this is for the best<br>
                    So tell me, why am I in tears?<br>
                    Woah, so far away and now I just need you here<br><br>               

                    So we fight through the hurt<br>
                    And we cry and cry and cry and cry<br>
                    Then we live and we learn<br>
                    And we try and try and try and try<br><br>

                    So it's up to you and it's up to me<br>
                    That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth<br>
                    Down to earth, down to earth<br>
                    On our way back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br>
                    Back down to earth, back down to earth<br><br>

                    We fell so far away from where we used to be<br>
                    Now we're standing and where do we go?<br>
                    When there's no road to get to your heart<br>
                    Let's start over again<br><br>

                    So it's up to you and it's up to me<br>
                    That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth<br>
                    Down to earth, down to earth<br>
                    On our way back down to earth<br>

                    I never thought that it'd be easy<br>
                    'Cause we both so distant now<br>
